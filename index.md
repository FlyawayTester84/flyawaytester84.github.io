### About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the Math Department at Harvard University. I am advised by [Prof. Peter Kronheimer](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~kronheim/). 

My research focuses on gauge theory and its applications to the geometry and topology of 4-manifolds. Currently, I am interested in the Seiberg-Witten theory and its stable homotopy refinements. 

Before Harvard, I graduated from [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu) with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and a minor in linguistics in 2023. I was advised by [Prof. Raphael Rouquier](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~rouquier/) on a project about cactus groups and by [Prof. Tim Hunter](https://timhunter.humspace.ucla.edu/) on a project about weighted context-free grammars. 

Outside of research, I enjoy practicing Kendo, playing chess, and reading.
