### About Me

Welcome to my website! I am a third year Ph.D. student at Harvard University, advised by [Prof. Peter Kronheimer](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~kronheim/). I graduated from [UCLA](ucla.edu) with a major in mathematics and minor in linguistics. 

My research focuses on gauge theory and its applications to the theory of 4-manifolds. Currently, I am interested in Seiberg-Witten theory and its stable homotopy refinements.
