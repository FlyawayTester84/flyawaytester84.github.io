My current research aims to develop a stable homotopy-theoretic interpretation of the Seiberg–Witten–Casson invariant for homology S^1 × S^3 manifolds, as introduced by Mrowka et al. I also investigate the invariant's dependence on spin structures, with the goal of distinguishing the two spin structures on a homology S^1 × S^3 via gauge-theoretic methods.
