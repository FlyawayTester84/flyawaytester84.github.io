My current research project aims to provide a stable homotopy theoretic interpretation of the Seiberg-Witten-Casson invariant on a homology S^1xS^3, introduced in Mrowka et al. Additionally, this project studies the dependence of the invariant on spin structures, possibly providing a way to distinguish the two spin structures on a homology S^1xS^3 gauge-theoretically.
